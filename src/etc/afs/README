Please enter an AFS cell near you in the ThisCell file.

The SuidCells file specifies cells, other than your home cell, for which
the AFS client will honor the setuid bit on binaries.

If you have an "unknown" cell that is not known in the CellServDB, make
sure to update CellServDB with your cell information.

afs is enabled by changing 'afs=NO' to 'afs=YES' in /etc/rc.conf
