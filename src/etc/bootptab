# First, we define a global entry which specifies the stuff every host uses.

#.global.dummy:\
#        :sm=255.255.255.0:\
#        :hd=/home/nfsclient:bf=null:\
#        :ds=128.32.149.141:\
#        :ns=0x80020b4d 0x80020ffd:\
#        :ts=0x80020b4d 0x80020ffd:\
#        :to=18000:

# Next, we can define different master entries for each subnet. . .

#subnet13.dummy:\
#	:tc=.global.dummy:gw=128.2.13.1:
#
#
# We should be able to use as many levels of indirection as desired.  Use
# your imagination. . .
#


# Individual entries (could also have different servers for some/all of these
# hosts, but we don't really use this feature at CMU):

#carnegie:tc=subnet13.dummy:ht=ieee802:ha=7FF8100000AF:ip=128.2.11.1:
#baldwin:tc=subnet19.dummy:ht=ethernet:ha=0800200159C3:ip=128.2.11.10:


#example nfs diskless client

#timesink:hd=/home/nfsclient/timesink:\
#	tc=subnet149.dummy:ht=ethernet:ha=0800200168A7:ip=128.32.149.20:
