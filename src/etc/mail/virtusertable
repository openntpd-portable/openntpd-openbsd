# sendmail(8) virtual user table.  Rebuild by running as root:
#   makemap hash /etc/mail/access < /etc/mail/access
#
# This file contains the mapping of virtual to local addresses.
# Each line denotes a transform of:
#   virtual_address	local_address
#
# E.g.
#   info@foo.com	foo-info
#   info@bar.com	bar-info
#   @baz.org		jane@example.net
#
# It is also possible to map all users from one domain to another, e.g.
#   @foo.org		%1@example.com
#
# See the "virtusertable" section of /usr/share/sendmail/README for
# more information.
