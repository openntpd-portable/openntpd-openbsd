# This file is separated into sections.  Each section is named with
# a label starting in column 0 and followed directly by a ``:''.  The
# section continues until the next section.  Blank lines and lines
# beginning with ``#'' are ignored.
#
# Lines beginning with "!include" will ``include'' another file.  You
# may want to ``!include ~/.ppp.conf'' for backwards compatibility.
#

# Default setup. Always executed when PPP is invoked.
#  This section is *not* loaded by the ``load'' or ``dial'' commands.
#
#  This is the best place to specify your modem device, its DTR rate,
#  and any logging specification.  Logging specs should be done first
#  so that subsequent commands are logged.

# Client side PPP
#
#  Although the PPP protocol is a peer to peer protocol, we normally
#  consider the side that makes the connection as the client and the
#  side that receives the connection as the server.  Authentication
#  is required by the server either using a unix-style login procedure
#  or by demanding PAP or CHAP authentication from the client.
#

# An on demand example where we have dynamic IP addresses:
#  If the peer assigns us an arbitrary IP (most ISPs do this) and we
#  can't predict what their IP will be either, take a wild guess at
#  some IPs that you can't currently route to.
#
#  The /0 bit in "set ifaddr" says that we insist on 0 bits of the
#  specified IP actually being correct, therefore, the other side can assign
#  any IP numbers.
#
#  The fourth arg to "set ifaddr" makes us send "0.0.0.0" as our requested
#  IP number, forcing the peer to make the decision.
#
#  This entry also works with static IP numbers or when not in -auto mode.
#  The ``add'' line adds a `sticky' default route that will be updated if
#  and when any of the IP numbers are changed in IPCP negotiations.
#  The "set ifaddr" is required in -auto mode.
#
#  Finally, the ``enable dns'' bit tells ppp to ask the peer for the
#  nameserver addresses that should be used.  This isn't always supported
#  by the other side, but if it is, /etc/resolv.conf will automatically be
#  updated.

# Ppp can accept control instructions from the ``pppctl'' program.
# First, you must set up your control socket.  It's safest to use
# a UNIX domain socket, and watch the permissions:
#
    set server /var/tmp/internet MySecretPassword 0177
#
# Although a TCP port may be used if you want to allow control
# connections from other machines:
#
    set server 6670 MySecretpassword

# Server side PPP
#  If you want the remote system to authenticate itself, you insist
#  that the peer uses CHAP (or PAP) with the "enable" keyword.  Both CHAP and
#  PAP are disabled by default (we usually only "enable" one of them if the
#  other side is dialing into our server).
#  When the peer authenticates itself, we use ppp.secret for verification.
#
#  Ppp is launched with:
#   # ppp -direct CHAPserver
#
#  Note:  We can supply a third field in ppp.secret specifying the IP address
#         for that user.  We can even specify a fourth field to specify the
#         ppp.link{up,down} label to use.
#

# If we wish to act as a server, allowing PAP access according to
# accounts in /etc/passwd, we do this  (Without `enable passwdauth',
# you may still enter ``*'' as the users password in ppp.secret and
# ppp will look it up in the passwd database.  This is useful if you
# need to assign a special label or IP number or range):

# Example to connect using a null-modem cable:
#  The important thing here is to allow the lqr packets on both sides.
#  Without them enabled, we can't tell if the line's dropped - there
#  should always be carrier on a direct connection.
#  Here, the server sends lqr's every 10 seconds and quits if five in a
#  row fail.
#
#  Make sure you don't have "deny lqr" in your default: on the client !
#  If the peer denies LQR, we still send ECHO LQR packets at the given
#  lqrperiod interval (ppp-style-pings).
