# remote -- remote host description database
# see tip(1), cgetcap(3), remote(5)
#
# Capabilities used in examples:
#
#   br	baud rate (defaults to 300)
#   dc	direct connect
#   dv	device to use for the tty
#   el	EOL marks (default is NULL)
#   ie	input EOF marks (default is NULL)
#   oe	output EOF string (default is NULL)
#   pa	parity
#   tc	include the named system description
#
# Most OpenBSD architectures use /dev/tty00, /dev/cua00, etc.
# for the 'standard' serial ports. Some architectures use
# /dev/ttya, /dev/cuaa, etc. The samples provide descriptions
# for the first serial port in each style.
#
# A few architectures such as the Alpha or HPPA either
# don't provide a serial port by default or have more complex
# naming conventions.
#
# In all cases make sure you are using the appropriate device
# name for the port you wish to access.
#
# System names can be anything, the samples use the device name
# for simplicity.
#
# NOTE:
#       a) Multiple :tc=XXX: capabilities are allowed, so that
#          various general pieces can be assembled into one
#          system description.
#       b) Only the first capability with the same name is
#          used. So capabilities with :tc=XXX: can be
#          overridden by assigning them a value before
#          including them. e.g. ":oe=^Z:" in doshost below.
#
# See cgetcap(3) for details on capability databases.
