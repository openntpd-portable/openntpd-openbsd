#
# Macros
#

# Define macros for the interfaces to be used by hostapd. The "wlan"
# interface is optional. 
wlan="ath0"
wired="sis0"

#
# Tables
#

# Define the MAC addresses (BSSIDs) for your accesspoints in a table.
table <myess> {
	00:90:4b:0d:fd:c8,
	00:02:6f:21:ea:8b

# Address masks are providing a simple way to match by MAC vendor ID.
#
# table <senao> { 00:02:6f:ff:ff:ff & ff:ff:ff:00:00:00 }

#
# Global options
#

# Uncomment this option to run hostapd in passive IAPP monitoring mode.
set hostap interface $wlan

# Should be the default, the opposite is "pcap" without radiotap headers.
set hostap mode radiotap

# According to the revised standard, multicast is used. hostapd supports
# broadcast for IAPP messages as well.
set iapp interface $wired
set iapp mode multicast

#
# Event rules
#

# Log probe requests
hostap handle type management subtype probe request \
   with iapp type radiotap

# Log and annoy foreign accesspoints
#
# This will be logged as well but the important thing is to
# annoy other accesspoints in your wireless territory.
hostap handle type data bssid !<myess> \
    with frame type management subtype deauth reason auth expire \
    from &bssid to ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff bssid &bssid

# The first de-auth example will not work with some newer stuff, like
# iwi(4)/ipw(4) "centrino", because they ignore management frames to
# the broadcast address as a countermeasure against the "void11"
# attack. 
#
# hostap handle type data bssid !<myess> \
#    with frame type management subtype deauth reason auth expire \
#    from &bssid to &from bssid &bssid

# Detect flooding of management frames except beacons.
# This will detect some possible Denial of Service attacks
# against the IEEE 802.11 protocol (like "void11").
hostap handle skip type management subtype ! beacon \
    with log \
    rate 100 / 10 sec

# Finally log any rogue accesspoints limited to every second.
# The skip keywords instructs hostapd to ignore further IAPP
# processing.
