.Sh NAME
.Nm ntpd.conf
.Nd Network Time Protocol daemon configuration file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Xr ntpd 8
daemon implements the Network Time Protocol
.Pq NTP
version 4.
This manual page describes the format of its configuration file,
.Nm .
The settings are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width "listenonXX"
.It Ar listen on
Specify a local IP address the
.Xr ntpd 8
daemon should listen on.
It can appear multiple times:
.Xr ntpd 8
will listen on each given address.
If
.Sq *
is given as an address,
.Xr ntpd 8
will listen on all local addresses.
.Xr ntpd 8
does not listen on any address by default.
For example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
listen on *
listen on 127.0.0.1
listen on ::1
.Ed
.It Ar server
Specify the IP address or the hostname of an NTP
server to syncronize to.
If the hostname resolves to multiple IPv4 and/or IPv6 adresses,
.Xr ntpd 8
uses the first address.
If it does not get a reply,
.Xr ntpd 8
retries with the next address and continues to do so unless a working address
is found.
For example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
server 10.0.0.2
server ntp.example.org
.Ed
.It Ar servers
As with
.Ar server ,
specify the IP address or hostname of an ntp server to synchronize to.
Should the hostname resolve to multiple IP adresses,
.Xr ntpd 8
will try synchronize to all of them.
For example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
servers pool.ntp.org
