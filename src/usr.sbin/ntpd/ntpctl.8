.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
program displays information about the running
.Xr ntpd 8
daemon.
.Pp
The options (which may be abbreviated) are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width "-s modifierX"
.It Fl s Cm all
Show all data.
.It Fl s Cm peers
Show the following information about each peer: weight, trustlevel,
stratum, number of seconds until the next poll, polling interval
in seconds, and offset, network delay and network jitter in milliseconds.
When the system clock is synced to a peer, an asterisk
is displayed to the left of the weight column for that peer.
.It Fl s Cm Sensors
Show the following information about each sensor: weight, sensor "good"
status, stratum, and offset and the configured correction in
milliseconds.
When the system clock is synced to a sensor, an asterisk
is displayed to the left of the weight column for that sensor.
.It Fl s Cm status
Show the status of peers and sensors, and whether the system clock is synced.
When the system clock is synced, the stratum is displayed.
When the system clock is not synced, the offset of the system clock,
as reported by the
.Xr adjtime 2
system call, is displayed.
When the median constraint is set, the offset to the local time is displayed.
