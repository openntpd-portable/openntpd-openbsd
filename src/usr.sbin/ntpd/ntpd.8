.Sh NAME
.Nm ntpd
.Nd "Network Time Protocol daemon"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm ntpd
.Bk -words
.Op Fl ds
.Op Fl f Ar file
.Ek
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
daemon synchronizes the local clock to one or more remote NTP servers,
and can also act as an NTP server itself,
redistributing the local time.
It implements the Simple Network Time Protocol version 4,
as described in RFC 2030,
and the Network Time Protocol version 3,
as described in RFC 1305.
.Pp
.Nm
uses the
.Xr adjtime 2 ,
system call to correct the local system time without causing time jumps.
.Nm
is usually started at boot time, and can be enabled by
setting the following in
.Pa /etc/rc.conf.local :
.Pp
.Dl ntpd_flags=\&"\&"
.Pp
See
.Xr rc 8
and
.Xr rc.conf 8
for more information on the boot process
and enabling daemons.
.Pp
When
.Nm
starts up, it reads settings from a configuration file,
typically
.Xr ntpd.conf 5 .
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width "-f fileXXX"
.It Fl d
Do not daemonize.
If this option is specified,
.Nm
will run in the foreground and log to
.Em stderr .
.It Fl f Ar file
Use
.Ar file
as the configuration file,
instead of the default
.Pa /etc/ntpd.conf .
.It Fl s
Set the time immediately once at startup to allow for a large time correction,
eleminating the need to run rdate before starting
.Nm .
