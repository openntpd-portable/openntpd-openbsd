.Sh DESCRIPTION
The MDX functions calculate a 128-bit cryptographic checksum (digest)
for any number of input bytes.
A cryptographic checksum is a one-way
hash-function, that is, you cannot find (except by exhaustive search)
the input corresponding to a particular output.
This net result is a
.Dq fingerprint
of the input-data, which doesn't disclose the actual input.
.Pp
MD4 has been broken; it should only be used where necessary for
backward compatibility.
MD5 has not yet (1999-02-11) been broken, but recent attacks have cast
some doubt on its security properties.
The attacks on both MD4 and MD5
are both in the nature of finding
.Dq collisions
\- that is, multiple
inputs which hash to the same value; it is still unlikely for an attacker
to be able to determine the exact original input given a hash value.
.Pp
The
.Fn MDXInit ,
.Fn MDXUpdate ,
and
.Fn MDXFinal
functions are the core functions.
Allocate an MDX_CTX, initialize it with
.Fn MDXInit ,
run over the data with
.Fn MDXUpdate ,
and finally extract the result using
.Fn MDXFinal .
When a null pointer is passed to
.Fn MDXFinal
as first argument only the final padding will be applied and the
current context can still be used with
.Fn MDXUpdate .
.Pp
The
.Fn MDXTransform
function is used by
.Fn MDXUpdate
to hash 512-bit blocks and forms the core of the algorithm.
Most programs should use the interface provided by
.Fn MDXInit ,
.Fn MDXUpdate
and
.Fn MDXFinal
instead of calling
.Fn MDXTransform
directly.
.Pp
.Fn MDXEnd
is a wrapper for
.Fn MDXFinal
which converts the return value to an MDX_DIGEST_STRING_LENGTH-character
(including the terminating '\e0')
.Tn ASCII
string which represents the 128 bits in hexadecimal.
.Pp
.Fn MDXFile
calculates the digest of a file, and uses
.Fn MDXEnd
to return the result.
If the file cannot be opened, a null pointer is returned.
.Fn MDXData
calculates the digest of a chunk of data in memory, and uses
.Fn MDXEnd
to return the result.
.Pp
When using
.Fn MDXEnd ,
.Fn MDXFile ,
or
.Fn MDXData ,
the
.Ar buf
argument can be a null pointer, in which case the returned string
is allocated with
.Xr malloc 3
and subsequently must be explicitly deallocated using
.Xr free 3
after use.
If the
.Ar buf
argument is non-null it must point to at least MDX_DIGEST_STRING_LENGTH
characters of buffer space.

.Sh HISTORY
These functions appeared in
.Ox 2.0 .
.Sh AUTHORS
The original MDX routines were developed by
.Tn RSA
Data Security, Inc., and published in the above references.
This code is derived from a public domain implementation by Colin Plumb.
.Pp
The
.Fn MDXEnd ,
.Fn MDXFile ,
and
.Fn MDXData
helper functions were written by Poul-Henning Kamp.
.Sh BUGS
Hans Dobbertin has shown collisions for the full version of MD4 and
found a collision in the compress function of MD5.
The use of SHA or RIPEMD-160 is recommended instead.
