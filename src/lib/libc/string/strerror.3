.Nm strerror
.Nd get error message string
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <string.h>
.Ft char *
.Fn strerror "int errnum"
.Ft int
.Fn strerror_r "int errnum" "char *strerrbuf" "size_t buflen"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn strerror
function returns a pointer to the language-dependent error message
string affiliated with the specified error number
.Fa errnum .
The returned string contains a maximum of
.Dv NL_TEXTMAX
characters, including the trailing NUL.
.Pp
The array pointed to is not to be modified by the program, but may be
overwritten by subsequent calls to
.Fn strerror .
.Pp
.Fn strerror_r
is a thread safe version of
.Fn strerror
that places the error message in the given buffer
.Fa strerrbuf .
If the error message is larger then
.Fa buflen
the message will be truncated to fit within buflen and
.Er ERANGE
is returned.
.Fn strerror_r
returns zero upon successful completion.
An error number is returned, otherwise.
